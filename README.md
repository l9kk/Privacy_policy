Our Application uses your device's camera to capture facial images for skincare analysis purposes. Here are the specific details about how we handle face data:

##### Face Data Collection and Processing

##### Face Data Storage and Retention

- **Local Processing:** When possible, facial images are processed locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
- **Server Processing:** When server-side analysis is required for advanced skincare assessment, facial images may be temporarily transmitted to our secure servers for processing only.
